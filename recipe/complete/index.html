        <h1> Strawberry Cream Crepe Cake</h1>
        <p> Buttery crepes layered up with fluffy whipped mascarpone and juicy California strawberries. Paper-thin layers of crepes give the cake a playful ruffled edge that looks like it took hours, but is simple to prepare and doesn’t require turning on the oven! The result is a spongelike texture that tastes a bit like strawberry shortcake.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol class="instructions">
        <li> Prepare a baking sheet or large cooling rack next to the stove.</li>
        <li>Combine all the crepe ingredients in a blender and blend for 15-20 seconds until completely smooth. Or whisk all the ingredients together in a large bowl until very well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Let the batter sit for 5 minutes while preheating the crepe pan or an 8 to 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Pans should be hot, but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Rub a stick of butter in the skillet. With the skillet in one hand, pour ¼ - ⅓ cup of batter into the hot skillet, while simultaneously tilting your wrist to rotate the pan so the batter spreads evenly to and around the edges of the pan. Fill in any cracks or holes with a dab of batter.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until the edges slightly curl up and turn slightly golden, and the top is no longer shiny, about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Use a rubber spatula to lift the edges of the crepe. Gently lift the edge of a crepe with your fingertips and quickly flip the crepe (or use a large rubber spatula to help flip the crepe if it's too hot).
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to a single layer on a baking sheet or wire rack to cool for a few minutes while cooking additional crepe(s), then stack on a plate once cool.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat until you've made at least 18 crepes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>For the filling, place the mascarpone, heavy cream, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a large bowl with a hand mixer.
        </li>
        <li>Whip on medium speed for several minutes until very soft peaks form. Whisk in the powdered sugar until firm peaks form, taking care not to over-mix.
        </li>
        <li>Place one crepe on a cake stand or plate and spread a thin layer of whipped mascarpone on top (about ¼ cup per layer).
        </li>

        <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of chopped strawberries over the cream and top with another crepe. Repeat, adding chopped strawberries to every other layer.
        </li>
        <li>Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to a day before slicing.
        </li>

    <h3>Tips: </h3>
    <p>Once the crepes are cooked, place them on a cooling rack before stacking together on a plate so the steam can evaporate and prevent them from getting soggy.</p>
    <p>If not assembling the crepes immediately, lay a piece of parchment paper in between each layer and store it in an airtight box for up to 2 days.</p>
</section>


<h3>Storage:</h3>
<p>Store cake uncovered in the fridge for up to one day. If storing longer than a day, store any leftovers in an air-tight container in the fridge</p>
