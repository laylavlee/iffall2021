                     42 cups 260g all-purpose flour (or 1¾ cups + 3 tablespoons (260g) Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 gluten-free flour)

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Prepare a baking sheet or large cooling rack next to the stove.</li>
                <li>Combine all the crepe ingredients in a blender and blend for 15-20 seconds until completely smooth. Or whisk all the ingredients together in a large bowl until very well combined.
                </li>
                <li>Let the batter sit for 5 minutes while preheating the crepe pan or an 8 to 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Pans should be hot, but not smoking.</li>
                <li>Rub a stick of butter in the skillet. With the skillet in one hand, pour ¼ - ⅓ cup of batter into the hot skillet, while simultaneously tilting your wrist to rotate the pan so the batter spreads evenly to and around the edges of the pan. Fill in any cracks or holes with a dab of batter.
                </li>
                <li>Cook until the edges slightly curl up and turn slightly golden, and the top is no longer shiny, about 2-3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Use a rubber spatula to lift the edges of the crepe. Gently lift the edge of a crepe with your fingertips and quickly flip the crepe (or use a large rubber spatula to help flip the crepe if it's too hot).
                </li>
                <li>Transfer to a single layer on a baking sheet or wire rack to cool for a few minutes while cooking additional crepe(s), then stack on a plate once cool.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat until you've made at least 18 crepes. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>For the filling, place the mascarpone, heavy cream, vanilla, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a large bowl with a hand mixer.
                </li>
                <li>Whip on medium speed for several minutes until very soft peaks form. Whisk in the powdered sugar until firm peaks form, taking care not to over-mix.
                </li>
                <li>Place one crepe on a cake stand or plate and spread a thin layer of whipped mascarpone on top (about ¼ cup per layer).
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of chopped strawberries over the cream and top with another crepe. Repeat, adding chopped strawberries to every other layer.
                </li>
                <li>Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to a day before slicing.
                </li>

                   I like being able to check off the ingredients list, and that the instructions are clear and simply organized.

               <li> <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/yellow-curry-chicken-with-vegetables">bonappetit.com</a>
                very clean design, the tools needed are directly linked to the product so easier to get if you don't have.
            </li>

                Process photos make it easier to understand the steps. Easier to follow because the instructions are sectioned out. I think I would try moving the tips and faqs after the instructions so I wouldn't have to scroll so much.
